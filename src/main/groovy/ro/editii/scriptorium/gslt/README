GSLT : The G Stylesheet Transformations
===============

GSLT is XSLT in Groovy syntax.

Easier to understand and maintain than XSLT, combining an easier to read DSL and the
power of Groovy to generate precisely the XSLT.

Keeps all the concepts of XSLT. Templates and all.

Whatever you write in XSLT, you can write in GSLT with less clutter.

But, whenever you feel like, you can just use regular, powerful groovy code.
