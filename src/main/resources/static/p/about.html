        <h1>About Etext.store</h1>

        <p>Etext.store is a repository of prestigious & referrable texts.</p>

        <p>What makes Etext.store special is the facility to reference any bit of text of its collections.</p>
        <p>Not only can you make a reference to a work, but any part of it, even that special special paragraph in the middle of the book! </p>

        <p>As such, not only do we offer pretty, common sense, stable URLs, like
            <a href="https://textbase.scriptorium.ro/cosbuc/balade_si_idile/rea_de_plata">https://textbase.scriptorium.ro/cosbuc/balade_si_idile/rea_de_plata</a>
            but you can quote any part of any work, be it a section, paragraph, verse or 
            any arbitrary chunk of text really.
        </p>

        <p>To see how seriously we take referencing, on Textbase you can actually reference a <em>letter</em> of a work
            using a unique URL that will never change.</p>

        <p>As such, Textbase is the ultimate database of the wisdom that you can share and
            refer chapter&verse, literally to the, hum, letter.</p>

        <p>That makes Textbase the perfect source for sharing & social 
            networking use of of prestigious text. Read a classic for school and quote it 
            on facebook!</p>

        <p>Yes, we're big.</p>
